# representational-drift
This repository contains a preliminary version of the code related to the paper _Representational Drift as the consequence of ongoing
memory storage_.
This is the current project structure:
```
ðŸ“¦ representational-drift
â”œâ”€Â src 
â”‚Â Â â””â”€Â network_simulations # contains source code for spiking network simulations
â””â”€Â data
```

## Spiking network simulation
Code was tested in a Linux environment. 
Apart from the environment requirements given in requirements.txt, a gfortran compiler should be installed in the machine (gfortran version 7.5.0 for example).
The spiking network simulations code is written in a Fortran routine (beta.f90) which is wrapped in a Python script (main_network_simulations.py). 
To execute a run, it is sufficient to set the simulations parameters in _main_network_simulations.py_, and then run the script from a terminal (with the environment with all necessary requirements activated),
for example bu running: 
```console
(my_conda_env) foo@bar:~$ python3 main_network_simulations.py
```
The output data is saved in the _data_ folder. 
As soon as possibile, I will add also the code to analyse and plot the results of the simulations, and run simulations of the statistical model.
